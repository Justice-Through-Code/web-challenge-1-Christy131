    <h1><strong>A Shropshire Lad</strong></h1>
        <p><em>'Lovliest</em> of trees, the cherry now is hung with the bloom \n
        along the bough, And stands about the woodland reide, wearing white for \n
        for Eastertide.'<p>
        <p><em>'Now</em> of my threescore years and ten, Twenty will not come again,\n 
        and take from sevemty springs a score, it only leaves me fifty more.'</p>
        <p><em>And</em> since to look on things in bloom fifty springs are little room,\n 
       about the woodlands I will go to see the cherry hung with snow.</p>
